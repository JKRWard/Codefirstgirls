<h2> Information about various things </h2>

<!-- add in different background images, get a banner at the bottom
of each div that foats up when hovered on  -->
<div class= "first">
      <p> This is the first paragraph that contains some information
         It would be cool to coordinate colours so that heading
         colours are in the same hues of blue as the ones in the
         header banner
      </p>
</div>

<div class = "second">
     <p> This is the second paragraph with all of its information.
        something here about att of the infographics and things
        that are inspiring - link to some initial illustrations
        think about how the website is going to be structured.
        would be good to get some content nailed down so that the site
        can be designed to start to show something useful
      </p>

      <p>
        Something about what I am working on , who I am, what
        I am interested in. Some images of illustrations/sketches etc.
        Add in here a link to the research group web page once that has
        been set out - get some content in to this so that the design
        can be created.
      </p>
</div>

<p> this is something that I'm trying out so I've started working
  in a new branch </p>
  <p> this is probably terrible</p>
