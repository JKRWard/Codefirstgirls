<div class= "first">
      <p> This is the first paragraph that contains some information
         It would be cool to coordinate colours so that heading

<div class = "second">
     <p> This is the second paragraph with all of its information.
        something here about att of the infographics and things
        that are inspiring - link to some initial illustrations
        think about how the website is going to be structured.
        would be good to get some content nailed down so that the site
        can be designed to start to show something useful
      </p>

      <p>
        Something about what I am working on , who I am, what
        I am interested in. Some images of illustrations/sketches etc.
        Add in here a link to the research group web page once that has
        been set out - get some content in to this so that the design
        can be created.

         A couple of weeks ago I lead a discussion amongst our research group about visual abstracts. Visual (or graphical) abstracts seem to have garnered some traction recently with suggestions that they can increase the readership of papers when used on social media. I've seen suggestions of their use increasing readership from 3-8 times that of a link to a paper shared without attached visuals, and although I'm sure these figures are rough approximations I think it's worth thinking about the visual abstract as a science communication tool that we can be using to spread the reach of our work.
         Visual abstracts were a fairly new concept to me, I've always had an interest in visualisations and infographics but I've never thought of myself as a particularly arty person. Although I've never had any artistic/graphics training (beyond the vast amounts of tracing that I did for my GCSE Art) I do know what I like and what I dont like. I think that is key, I'm not a professional illustrator and there's probably lots of graphic design considerations that haven't even crossed my mind but that's not going to stop me from having a go. We all know that publishing papers is an important part of academic life but if theres something fairly simple that we could be doing to then encourage people to actually read those papers then surely that can only be a good thing.
         - side note here about the discussion that we had where other eople didn't like something that I loved -

         Visual abstracts seem to have come from the medical research world where they seem to be more common (certainly more so than in ecology) and from a quick scroll through of the search results from #visualabstract many of these medical visuals seem to follow a similar format. - insert some images - whils't these are a good starting point (and are certainly better than nothing) I'm sure people wont mind me saying that they arent the most visually appealing things you've ever seen.
         To me it's a no brainer, I know that the way my brain works I'm much more likely to remeber something if it's associated with pictures (partly why I'ver recently been playing around with sketchnotes when summarising my notes on a paper) so the use of a visual seems logical not only to try and encourage people to read your paper but also to get them to remember it. An example of this, during the session I showed everyone some examples of visual abstracts that I had found largely by just searching the hashtag on twitter so that we could discuss which ones we thought were the most effective. One of the examples was this cool graphic for a paper on - diplozoosomething or other the fox eating one - to which someone responded that they remembered having read that paper beacause they had enjoyed the graphic.

<p> this is something that I'm trying out so I've started working
  in a new branch </p>
